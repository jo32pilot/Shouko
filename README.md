# Shouko Bot

Hi, I'm Shouko! I assign Discord roles based on how much time a member has spent
in a voice channel. Yes, I am aware of the irony.

# Invite Me!
I'm not the best bot in the world but I promise to try and make your Discord 
experience at least a little better!\

If you noticed the hard coded key in the previous commits, don't worry. That
key has since been deprecated and replaced.
