# Shouko Bot

Hi, I'm Shouko! I assign Discord roles based on how much time a member has spent
in a voice channel. Yes, I am aware of the irony.

# Invite Me!
I'm not the best bot in the world but I promise to try and make your Discord 
experience at least a little better!\
Invite me [here!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=462379854629699594&scope=bot&permissions=268659712)

# What I need to work
I can only assign roles that are lower in the role hierarchy than my own.
In your server settings, under the roles tab, drag any of my roles above
any roles you want me to manage, like so\
