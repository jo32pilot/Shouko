# Shouko Bot
![](https://data.whicdn.com/images/293013699/original.gif)\
Hi, I'm Shouko! I assign Discord roles based on how much time a member has spent
in a voice channel. Yes, I am aware of the irony.

# Invite Me!
I'm not the best bot in the world but I promise to try and make your Discord 
experience at least a little better!\

# Notes
* If you noticed the hard coded key in the previous commits, don't worry. That
key has since been deprecated and replaced.
* This bot doesn't work on servers with several thousand members. In fact, I have to
blacklist those servers otherwise the bot might crash upon command usage. Sorry if
you're one of those servers!
